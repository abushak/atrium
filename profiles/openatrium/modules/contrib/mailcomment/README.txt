OVERVIEW
--------
Mail Comment lets you respond to posts by email. It links outgoing Notifications
or Message Notify emails with incoming email responses via Mailhandler using a
combination of mail parameters and digital signatures.

When enabled, it adds to outgoing notifications emails a message that looks like

((( Reply ABOVE this LINE to POST a COMMENT )))

Then the receiver just needs to reply to the mail and the text above will be
posted to the original thread as a comment.
